# SmugMug Backup Docker Image

This repository contains artifacts to build a Docker image that can be used to download all the images and videos from a 
SmugMug account.  

It's a simple docker deployment of Tommaso Visconti's [smugmug-backup](https://github.com/tommyblue/smugmug-backup) project.  I used 
BjÃ¶rn Gernert's [docker-smugmug-backup](https://hub.docker.com/r/bgernert/docker-smugmug-backup) as a starting point for my own 
implementation.  I built my own image because I wanted to make sure I was using the latest code (smugmug-backup seems to be 
actively maintained).

## Building

The `build.sh` script should build the image to the tag `michaeljmuller/smugmug-backup-docker`.  The script assumes 
your current working directory is the root of this project.

## Configuration

This image expects you to mount a volume where the images will be written.  The default path where the 
container writes the photos is `/photos`, but you can change that by setting the `SB_DESTINATION` 
environment variable.

Complete list of environment variables (see [Tommasso's README](https://github.com/tommyblue/smugmug-backup#configuration) 
for explanations):
 - SB_API_KEY
 - SB_API_SECRET
 - SB_USER_TOKEN
 - SB_USER_SECRET
 - SB_DESTINATION
 - SB_FILE_NAMES
 - SB_USE_METADATA_TIMES
 - SB_FORCE_METADATA_TIMES
 - SB_WRITE_CSV
 - SB_FORCE_VIDEO_DOWNLOAD
 - SB_CONCURRENT_ALBUMS
 - SB_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS

## Running

Here's sample command to use this image:

```
docker run -it \
       -e "SB_API_KEY=REDACTED" \
       -e "SB_API_SECRET=REDACTED" \
       -e "SB_USER_TOKEN=REDACTED" \
       -e "SB_USER_SECRET=REDACTED" \
       -e "SB_CONCURRENT_ALBUMS=5" \
       -e "SB_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS=10" \
       -v /opt/photos/smugmug:/photos \
       michaeljmuller/smugmug-backup-docker
```
